# Custom React App
_Any commands below will assume you're using `yarn`. If you're not, you can install it [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). If you're still not, I dunno that's your fault I'm not helping_

`create-react-app` is a great way to bootstrap a new site, and comes with a number of other benefits: config is hidden away in one dependency, leaving you to get on with the important stuff and taking a load off your mind; you can update a project with the latest of all this config and tooling in-place, in a few seconds; and every project built with it has a familiar base reducing the ramp-up time as you and your teammates switch projects.

## The Problem
All of this is great, but sometimes you need that extra bit of configurability - one jest parameter which isn't supported by CRA, an extra webpack loader, or a different ESLint rule set. The easiest way to do this is to run `yarn eject`, unpacking all of what CRA hides away for you and dropping it in your project root for you to do with as you please. Unfortunately in doing this you lose the in-place updates with the latest tooling from Facebook, the configuration facade that lets you focus on development, and inevitably projects begin again to diverge.

## The Solution
The `create-react-app` repository is an example of a [monorepo](https://medium.com/@bebraw/the-case-for-monorepos-907c1361708a). It contains a number of packages within, each its own module and individually published, but all having some involvement in `create-react-app`. One of these packages is called `react-scripts`, and within it is all of the configuration and default project files included when you create a new CRA project. By forking the repo and publishing our own version of the `react-scripts` package we can take full control of these, without losing the benefits of using `create-react-app`.

If you use the forked scripts on a team, this also means that one person's improvements can benefit everybody - even those working on existing projects - and you'll still get all the new work from Facebook's end too.

## How tho

### Fork CRA
To fork the repo, open [it on github](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and hit "Fork" in the top-right (sign in if you haven't already). This will create a copy of the repository under the same name but in your github account. Now clone your forked repo somewhere, `cd` in to it and run `yarn`. There'll be a little more output than usual here while it sets up dependencies for the individual packages within the repo.

### Make your changes

Once the process completes, browse to `packages/react-scripts` in your editor. You'll see a few key files and folders inside.

* `config` - contains configuration for Jest, webpack builds and dev server
* `scripts` - this scripts available for running in a `create-react-app` project such as `yarn start` and `yarn build`
* `template` - the files you actually see when you've run `create-react-app` - the base of every new project
  * note the file `gitignore` instead of `.gitignore` - this is to avoid ignoring files from the template itself, but will be automatically renamed when generating a project
* `package.json` - describes this package and its dependencies

This is where you can now customise the output of CRA to work better for you. Here are a few of our tweaks in the Amido fork, linked to the relevant commits in case you want to try something similar:
  
  * [CSS module support](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/commit/49cff874da7127720260bae5a45ac57f56b34177) - because CSS modules are ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. We'd gotten used to the isolation and convenience of CSS modules and going back to plain CSS was not an option
  * [Redux devtool store enhancer under `template\src\util`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/commit/9e62e10a7e2e5ca2541cce3444a8e51df9fd1fcf) - invaluable during development and preconfigured not to run in production, almost every project will make use of this. And if not, since it's in the `template` it's exposed and can be easily removed after project creation
  * [Expose and modify `.eslintrc`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/commit/8f87c8a3f0f52a346a849f10c5fd18be8384f73f) - this still includes `react-app`'s default rules, but adds airbnb's rules on top for cleaner code and greater style consistency. As we figure out an optimal rule set (some of airbnb's are a bit overzealous for our taste) we can drop changes in here, and eventually bring it back to the hidden `config` folder when we're happy with the set
  * [Include .editorconfig](https://github.com/amido/create-react-app/commit/5091891866823f923264d8e11d2f14179fcf584b#diff-a5ccaae40c0850dda3e020a790e16c6d) - for supporting editors to automatically set indentation and other rules

### Try it out

Once you're happy with your changes it's time to test them out. You'll need to head up to the root of your repo and create a project using your local changes:

```sh
cd ../.. # head up from `react-scripts` two levels
yarn create-react-app test-app # create a 'test-app' project with your CRA changes
```

If all goes well, you can now explore the resulting `test-app` folder and try running the project locally:

```sh
cd test-app
yarn start
```

### Publish

When you're happy with your changes, you just need to publish them to npm. This makes them publicly available and ready for consumption by anybody using `create-react-app`. If you don't have an npm account, first register and sign in by following the ["Create a user" instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Navigate back to the `packages/react-scripts` directory.

First, we need to give the package a distinct name. Open up `package.json` and replace the `name` field with whatever you want to call this package (this will be the name by which people reference it to use with CRA). Make sure it's available by checking `npm.im/package-name`. For any future updates, note you'll also need to increment the version number.

Now, still in the `react-scripts` directory, run 
```bash
npm publish
```

Your customised `react-scripts` is now ready to be used by you and your team or anyone you wish to share it with! Try it out like so, replacing 'amido-react-scripts' with your package's name:

```sh
yarn global add create-react-app # if you haven't got CRA installed
create-react-app --scripts-version=amido-react-scripts my-new-app
cd my-new-app
yarn start
```

If (as is hopefully the case) you find yourself using your custom scripts regularly, an alias can save time and make it easier to remember. In my `aliases.zsh` I have 

```zsh
alias create-amido-app="create-react-app --scripts-version=amido-react-scripts"
```
